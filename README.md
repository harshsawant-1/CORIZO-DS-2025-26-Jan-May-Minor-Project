# CORIZO-DS-2025-26-Jan-May-Minor-Project
This capstone project demonstrates the use of Numpy and Matplotlib in-depth analysis of body measurement data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The data contains body metrics of adult males and females across various dimensions, allowing us to compare key physical attributes and derive important health indicators.

Capstone Project 1: Working with Numpy Matrices (Multidimensional Data)
Project Overview
This project analyzes body measurement data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), specifically focusing on the adult male and female datasets. By utilizing Numpy for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization, we explore various anthropometric attributes, calculate key health indices, and compare distributions between genders. This notebook is designed to be an in-depth analytical report, suitable for presentation to stakeholders interested in health and nutrition data.

Data Description
The datasets (nhanes_adult_male_bmx_2020.csv and nhanes_adult_female_bmx_2020.csv) contain body measurements of adult males and females across the following seven columns:

Weight (kg)
Standing Height (cm)
Upper Arm Length (cm)
Upper Leg Length (cm)
Arm Circumference (cm)
Hip Circumference (cm)
Waist Circumference (cm)
These files should be placed in the project directory to ensure they are accessible for analysis.

Project Objectives and Steps
Data Loading and Preparation

Import necessary libraries (Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Load male and female CSV files into Numpy matrices.
Data Visualization

Histogram of Weights: Plot two histograms on a single figure to visualize weight distributions for both males and females, with identical x-axis limits.
Boxplot of Weights: Generate side-by-side box plots to compare the central tendency and spread of male and female weights.
Statistical Analysis

Basic Statistics: Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, and skewness of weights for males and females.
Interpretation: Discuss and compare these distributions in terms of skewness, dispersion, and central tendency.
BMI and Ratios Calculation

BMI for Females: Calculate and add the BMI (Body Mass Index) column to the female dataset.
Standardization: Create a standardized (z-score) version of the female dataset for further analysis.
Correlation Analysis

Scatterplot Matrix: Visualize relationships between height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and BMI for females.
Pearson and Spearman Correlations: Compute correlation coefficients between selected features to assess linear and monotonic relationships.
Ratio Calculations and Comparison

Waist-to-Height and Waist-to-Hip Ratios: Calculate these ratios for both male and female participants.
Boxplot Comparison: Use box plots to compare the distributions of these ratios between genders.
Advantages and Disadvantages of BMI and Ratios

Comparison of Health Metrics: Outline the advantages and limitations of BMI, waist-to-height ratio, and waist-to-hip ratio in assessing health.
Extreme BMI Analysis

Extract and print standardized measurements for individuals with the lowest and highest BMIs. Discuss any trends or patterns observed.

Results Interpretation
The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the NHANES body measurement data, highlighting gender-based differences in body metrics, insights into health indices like BMI, and examining the effectiveness of various health ratios. This report is intended for stakeholders interested in health assessment, data science, and population studies.
